For a production application, you would need to add the following sound files to this directory:

1. ticking-mechanical.mp3 - A mechanical clock ticking sound
2. ticking-digital.mp3 - A digital ticking sound
3. alarm-kitchen.mp3 - A kitchen timer alarm sound
4. alarm-digital.mp3 - A digital alarm sound
5. alarm-bell.mp3 - A bell alarm sound

These sound files should be short, optimized MP3 files. You can find free sound effects at:
- FreeSound.org
- SoundBible.com
- ZapSplat.com

For the ticking sounds, a 1-2 second file that's set to loop works best.
For alarm sounds, 2-5 second files are ideal.

Make sure you have appropriate rights to use any sounds in your application.
